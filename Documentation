Time Complexity
-------------------------------
The worst case time complexity for the dijkstra function (shortest path) is O(|V|*log(|V|)), where |V| is the number of stops in the graph. In the worst case it would need to iterate through the whole graph just to find the vertex searched for, and that takes linear time (O(|V|)). In each loop iteration, we need to take an element from the Priority queue, then delete it from the queue and insert it in a table. We also have to calculate all the neibours that the element has, which have a worst time complexity of O(|E|), where |E| is the number of edges from that vertex. All the priority queue operations take O(log(|V|)) time, and thus the total time complexity is O(|V|)*O(|E|)*O(log(|V|)) = O(|V||E|log(|V|)).
